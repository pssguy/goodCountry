[The Good Country Index](https://goodcountry.org/index/about-the-index) aspires to measure what each country on earth contributes to the common good of humanity, and what it takes away, relative to its size

Devised by [Simon Anholt](https://goodcountry.org/simon-anholt)
and developed by [Robert Govers] (http://rgovers.com/) it utilizes a wide range of data from [UN and other sources](https://goodcountry.org/index/source-data).
